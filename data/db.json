      "body": "Websites consist of two parts: the front end, which users experience, and the back end, which comprises the invisible structure making the front end possible. The difference between front-end and back-end development can seem confusing, given their similarities in making websites function properly.\n\nFront-end developers design the visual aspects of websites for users to interact with, including colors, layout, and fonts. Back-end developers create the invisible structure that helps websites function properly. Back-end developers have a different technical skillset and make higher salaries than front-end developers.\n\nFull-stack developers work with all parts of a website and use front-end and back-end coding skills. Keep reading to learn more about front-end vs. back-end development, including key proficiencies required for both focuses.\nFront-End Development\n\nFront-end development focuses on the user-facing side of a website. Front-end developers ensure that visitors can easily interact with and navigate sites by using programming languages, design skills, and other tools. They produce the drop-down menus, layouts, and designs for websites.\n\nFront-end devs use computer programming languages like JavaScript, HyperText Markup Language (HTML), and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to design websites. Each language serves a unique purpose. HTML lays out the site's content and structure, CSS adds design features, and JavaScript creates advanced interactive features. Less commonly, front-end devs know other programming languages like Python, PHP, or Ruby.\n\nThese developers need expertise using frameworks and libraries like jQuery, Bootstrap, AngularJS, and EmberJS. Frameworks ensure that content appears correctly on all devices, while libraries condense code into smaller, time-saving packages. Front-end devs may also use graphic design programs like Photoshop or Sketch, along with code editing tools like Notepad or Eclipse.\n\nFront-end development requires technical expertise and creativity to ensure websites' user interfaces look correct and function properly. Front-end devs work with back-end developers, designers, and user experience analysts.\n\nA front-end developer typically needs a bachelor's degree in web design, programming, computer science, or graphic design. Some individuals develop these skills through previous work, coding bootcamps, or projects to find employment without pursuing formal education.\n\nFront-End Developer Skills\n\nHTML\n    HTML is the standard programming language for implementing a webpage's general content and structure.\nCSS\n    Front-end developers use CSS to create a webpage's colors, style, layout, and fonts. These devs may use CSS preprocessors like SASS or LESS to speed up the development process.\nJavaScript\n    Front-end developers use JavaScript for sites that use interactive features like videos, audio, animations, and games. JavaScript includes libraries with extensions and plugins to run faster on websites.\nCommunication Skills\n    Effective communication skills help front-end developers work effectively with clients and back-end developers on web projects. Developers may need to explain design issues to clients who may not have technical backgrounds.\nCreativity\n    Creative front-end developers improve the look, feel, and usability of websites. They help to ensure that a site is visually pleasing and easy to navigate beyond functionality alone.\n\nTop Online Programs\n\nExplore programs of your interests with the high-quality standards and flexibility you need to take your career to the next level.\nBack-End Development\n\nBack-end developers focus on the server side of websites. They use technical skills to perform the behind-the-scenes work that creates a website's structure and overall functionality, allowing a site's front end to exist. These professionals create a site's operations, databases, and application programming interface (API).\n\nThe back end includes an application, server, and database. Computer users often do not see the elements of back-end development, which remain below the hood of a website.\n\nBack-end developers need advanced experience in server-side programming languages like Java, Python, and Ruby to build applications. Students can learn or brush up on specific computer programming languages by completing bootcamps. For example, see our page on the best Python bootcamps.\n\nBack-end devs use tools like SQL Server and Oracle to store, organize, and change data. Employers often require expertise with PHP frameworks, version control software, and debugging back-end systems and applications. Back-end devs collaborate with front-end developers, management, and business stakeholders to understand each project's goals.\n\nMost employers require back-end devs to hold bachelor's degrees in computer science, programming, or web development. Some back-end devs can find employment without earning four-year degrees by learning through relevant work experience or bootcamps.\n\nWith additional training, education, or certifications, some back-end developers can translate their experience into higher-paying careers as software engineers. Below, we explain some skills that back-end developers usually possess.\n\nBack-End Developer Skills\n\nPython\n    Back-end devs use the Python programming language to write data structures and algorithms to create websites. They also use Python libraries and frameworks, like Flask, Django, and NumPy.\nJava\n    Developers on the back end use this programming language, created for compatibility with other platforms, to build applications.\nRuby\n    Ruby is a free, open-source, back-end programming language. Back-end devs can use it to quickly create new applications. Ruby includes everything a site needs to run, so full-stack developers also often use the language. Ruby works especially well for high-traffic websites.\nProblem-Solving Skills\n    Back-end development often requires problem-solving skills to fix technical problems in the website creation process. These tasks may include debugging and testing back-end systems and applications.\nCommunication Skills\n    Back-end developers need strong communication skills to complete projects effectively. Developers may need to explain technical web design issues to stakeholders that may not have tech knowledge.\n\nWhat's the Difference Between Front-End and Back-End?\n\nAll websites require front-end and back-end development. Front-end development focuses on the visual aspects of a website — the part that users see and interact with. Back-end development comprises a site's structure, system, data, and logic. Together, front-end and back-end development combine to create interactive, visually pleasing websites.\n\nBoth types of developers need strong coding skills. Front-end devs use programming languages to bring the client side of a site to life. This development takes technical, creative, and communication skills. Back-end developers use server-side programming languages to ensure that websites function properly.\n\nBack-end devs remain in high demand for their technical expertise. According to March 2023 PayScale data, back-end developers earn $90,652 on average, while front-end developers make an average of $80,796.\n\nThe following table compares front-end vs. back-end developers.\n\nFront-End vs. Back-End Developers\nWhat They Do\n\tFront-end developers focus on designing the physical appearance of websites with front-end programming languages. The visual aspect of a website is the result of front-end development — including fonts, colors, layout, and graphics.\n\tBack-end developers create the structure or logic of a website by using server-side programming languages. They write code that tells the website how to bring the front-end programming languages alive.\nAverage Salary\n\t$80,796\n\t$90,652\nProgramming Languages\n\tJavaScript, HTML, CSS\n\tPython, Java, Ruby, PHP\nFrameworks & Libraries\n\tjQuery, AngularJS, SASS, Bootstrap, EmberJS\n\tDjango, Laravel, Spring, Zend, Symfony, CakePHP\nWho They Work With\n\tBack-end developers, clients, management, business stakeholders\n\tFront-end developers, management, business stakeholders\n\nFull-Stack Development\n\nFull-stack development encompasses the entirety of an application, including back-end and front-end development. Instead of specializing in one type of development, full-stack developers apply their skills to both. Companies usually hire full-stack developers for their \"big picture\" mindsets and complete understanding of the creation process.\n\nFull-stack devs know front-end and back-end programming languages, like JavaScript, Java, Python, and CSS. Other typical skills include experience with web architecture, developing algorithms, databases, and Git and GitHub.\n\nBecoming a full-stack developer takes longer and requires mastery of two types of skills. Pursuing full-stack development can open the door to more opportunities and help you stand out from the competition. PayScale reports that full-stack developers earned an average annual salary of $81,902 as of March 2023.\nQuestions About Types of Software Engineering\nIs front-end development easy?\n\nNo, but some people may find it easier than back-end development. Front-end developers need strong coding skills, but back-end development takes more advanced technical expertise.\nWhat is needed for front-end development?\n\nFront-end devs use front-end programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Front-end developers also use frameworks and libraries like jQuery, AngularJS, SASS, Bootstrap, EmberJS. The best front-end devs display creativity, good communication, and up-to-date technical skills.\nWhat does a back-end developer do?\n\nBack-end developers are responsible for the behind-the-scenes work that it takes to build the structure and logic of a website. They create the invisible \"brain\" of websites run beneath the user-facing side.\nHow do I become a back-end developer?\n\nBack-end developers typically hold bachelor's degrees in web development, programming, computer science, or other related fields. Some employers hire back-end devs who develop their skills through work experience, bootcamps, or certification programs.\n",

      "body": "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), the wildly successful first-person shooter produced by video game developer Valve, was released in August 2012 and has been an esports mainstay ever since.\n\nDespite its ongoing success, with the game still continuously breaking records for concurrent users 11 years after its release, the recently announced Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) follow-up will begin replacing CS:GO at esports majors in March 2024. The PGL CS2 Major Copenhagen 2024 will be the first to make the switch, with others expected to follow suit.\n\nCS:GO is a PC-based multiplayer game in which players join one of two teams, Terrorists or Counter-Terrorists, fighting in round-based matches. Players earn in-game currency to buy weapons and equipment, helping to achieve objectives and win each round.\n\nIt is also a huge esports title, with annual CS:GO tournament prize money estimated to be upwards of $20 million and concurrent viewership routinely in the hundreds of thousands, often peaking above a million.\n\nSo, it came as a surprise to many in March when Valve announced CS2, claiming “the next era of Counter-Strike begins this summer” with the “largest technical leap forward in Counter-Strike’s history.”",
